SPEC
- always show expl info relevant to DP prior to current step
- do not resurrect maps and overlays
- never show combined saliency

- if easy, allow them to go back and re-shighlight and overlay




chartData set in explanationsV2 when expl info arrives

which happens due to askBackendForExplanationRewardInfo

which runs when 
	- why button clicked 1rst, 3rd,5th time
	- when arrive at DP diamond for T1
	- if currentExplManager.chartVisible when arrive at DP
	
	
	BUT explanationsV2 caches the data and uses the cached if exists for that step - is the step wrong - i.e. the step jumped to?
